## 2025-01-18 (Day 1)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Performed complete sanity check of Laravel project
  - Files reviewed: All controllers, models, routes, views, config
  - Issues found: 17 total (1 critical, 3 high, 8 medium, 5 low)
  - Documentation created: SANITY_CHECK_REPORT.md

- [x] Created documentation structure
  - Files created: docs/SANITY_CHECK_REPORT.md, docs/TODO_CHECKLIST.md, docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md
  - Purpose: Track fixes and maintain accountability

### Decisions Made
- SQLite for local development, MySQL for production is intentional - no changes needed
- English in code, German in UI is correct approach - maintains code readability
- Rate limiting is highest priority due to security implications
- Test coverage should focus on critical user paths first

### Blockers/Issues
- Rate limiting was documented but never implemented - needs immediate fix
- No existing test structure beyond Laravel defaults
- CalendarController complexity needs refactoring but works correctly

### Next Steps
- Add rate limiting to login route (CRITICAL)
- Start with AuthenticationTest.php for test coverage
- Create first Form Request class as proof of concept

### Notes
- User clarified that database difference is intentional (SQLite local, MySQL production)
- README.md line 160 has typo: "composer run dev" should be "npm run dev"
- All user-facing content must remain in German

## 2025-01-18 (Day 1 - Continued)

### Tasks Completed (Second Session)
- [x] Added rate limiting to login route ✅
  - Files modified: routes/web.php
  - Issue encountered: Standard Laravel 429 page was too technical
  - Solution: Added `->middleware('throttle:5,1')` and created German 429 error page
  - Testing: Verified middleware appears in route:list

- [x] Created user-friendly 429 error page in German
  - Files created: resources/views/errors/429.blade.php
  - Features: Countdown timer, friendly message, no technical jargon
  - Matches existing error page design

### Decisions Made
- Used Laravel's built-in throttle middleware instead of custom solution
- Created German error page with countdown timer to improve UX
- Kept explanation simple and non-technical for parent audience

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### Next Steps
- Create AuthenticationTest.php for test coverage
- Fix README.md typo on line 160
- Create first Form Request class

### Commit Summary
- Commit message: "Add login rate limiting and user-friendly 429 error page"
- Files changed: 3 files (routes/web.php, 429.blade.php, docs files)

## 2025-01-18 (Day 1 - Session 3)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Fixed calendar AJAX navigation shift volunteer count bug
  - Files modified: CalendarController.php, Shift.php, calendar views
  - Issue: AJAX requests weren't eager loading volunteers relationship
  - Solution: Added `->with(['shifts.volunteers'])` and optimized Shift model accessors
  - Simplified to use single `filled` attribute throughout

- [x] Cleaned up Shift model calculations
  - Removed redundant `total_filled` attribute
  - Standardized on `filled` as main attribute
  - Added `relationLoaded()` checks to prevent N+1 queries

### Quick Wins Completed
- [x] Fixed README.md typo (composer run dev → npm run dev)
- [x] Created first Form Request (UpdateBulletinRequest)
- [x] Removed inline styles from calendar views (added Tailwind class)

### Decisions Made
- No backward compatibility needed (new project)
- Standardize on `filled` attribute for shift calculations
- Always eager load relationships in controllers
- Commit after each TODO checklist item completion

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### Next Steps
- Start creating test suites (AuthenticationTest)
- Continue with Form Request classes
- Consider implementing invisible captcha

### Commit Summary
- Will commit bug fixes and improvements separately going forward
