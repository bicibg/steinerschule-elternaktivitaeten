## 2025-01-18 (Day 1)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Performed complete sanity check of Laravel project
  - Files reviewed: All controllers, models, routes, views, config
  - Issues found: 17 total (1 critical, 3 high, 8 medium, 5 low)
  - Documentation created: SANITY_CHECK_REPORT.md

- [x] Created documentation structure
  - Files created: docs/SANITY_CHECK_REPORT.md, docs/TODO_CHECKLIST.md, docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md
  - Purpose: Track fixes and maintain accountability

### Decisions Made
- SQLite for local development, MySQL for production is intentional - no changes needed
- English in code, German in UI is correct approach - maintains code readability
- Rate limiting is highest priority due to security implications
- Test coverage should focus on critical user paths first

### Blockers/Issues
- Rate limiting was documented but never implemented - needs immediate fix
- No existing test structure beyond Laravel defaults
- CalendarController complexity needs refactoring but works correctly

### Next Steps
- Add rate limiting to login route (CRITICAL)
- Start with AuthenticationTest.php for test coverage
- Create first Form Request class as proof of concept

### Notes
- User clarified that database difference is intentional (SQLite local, MySQL production)
- README.md line 160 has typo: "composer run dev" should be "npm run dev"
- All user-facing content must remain in German
